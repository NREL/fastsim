# Description
This is the python/rust flavor of [NREL's FASTSim](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/fastsim.html), which is based on the original Excel implementation. Effort will be made to keep the core methodology between this software and the Excel flavor in line with one another. 

All classes and methods are self-documented.  

# Installation

## Python 
Set up and activate a python environment (compatible with Python 3.8 - 3.10; we recommend Python 3.10) with the following steps.
### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
1. Create: `conda create -n fastsim python=3.10`
1. Activate: `conda activate fastsim`

### [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
There is some variation based on your Operating System:  

- PowerShell (windows):
    1. Create: `python -m venv fastsim-venv` -- name is user decision
    1. Activate: `fastsim-venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`

- Bash (i.e. unix/linux/mac):
    1. Create: `python -m venv fastsim-venv` -- name is user decision
    1. Activate: `source fastsim-venv/bin/activate`

- Command Prompt (windows):
    1. Create: `python -m venv fastsim-venv` -- name is user decision
    1. Activate: `fastsim-venv/Scripts/activate.bat`

## FASTSim
### Via PyPI
In an active Python environment created above, run `pip install fastsim`.

### Building from Scratch
Developers might want to install the code in place so that FASTSim files can be editable (the `-e` flag for pip provides this behavior). This option can be handy since FASTSim will be installed in place from the installation location and any updates will be propagated each time FASTSim is freshly imported.  To do this, you'll need to have the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

- Option 1: run `sh build_and_test.sh` in root folder.  
- Option 2:  
    1. Run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`  
    Optional testing steps:
    1. Run `cd rust/ && cargo test`
    1. Run `pytest -v python/fastsim/tests/`

# Usage
To see and run examples, navigate to `./python/fastsim/demos` and run the various *demo.py files to see fastsim use cases. There are other examples in fastsim/tests.  


# Adding FASTSim as a Depency in Rust
## Via GitHub
Add this line:  
`fastsim-core = { git = "https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/fastsim", branch = "rust-port" }`  
to your Cargo.toml file, modifying the `branch` key as appropriate.  

## Via Cargo
This has not been implemented yet.

# Known Issues
Rust versions of classes have limited Language Server Protocol integration, and we are actively working on fixing this.  

# Release Notes
2.1.0 -- release and installation improvements, RustVehicle init cleanup, calibration improvements
2.0.11 - 2.0.22 -- PyPI fixes.  Also, Rust version is now >100x faster than Python version.   
2.0.10 -- logging fixes, proc macro reorganization, some CAVs performance fixes  
2.0.9 -- support for mac ARM/RISC architecture  
2.0.8 -- performance improvements  
2.0.6 -- `dist_v2_m` fixes and preliminary CAV functionality  
2.0.5 -- added `to_rust` method for cycle  
2.0.4 -- exposed `veh.set_veh_mass`  
2.0.3 -- exposed `veh.__post_init__`  
2.0.2 -- provisioned for non-default vehdb path  
2.0.1 -- bug fix  
2.0.0 -- All second-by-second calculations are now implemented in both rust and python.  Rust provides a ~30x speedup  
1.3.1 -- `fastsim.simdrive.copy_sim_drive` function can deepcopy jit to non-jit (and back) for pickling  
1.2.6 -- time dilation bug fix for zero speed  
1.2.4 -- bug fix changing `==` to `=`  
1.2.3 -- `veh_file` can be passed as standalone argument.  `fcEffType` can be anything if `fcEffMap` is provided, but typing is otherwise enforced.  
1.2.2 -- added checks for some conflicting vehicle parameters.  Vehicle parameters `fcEffType` and `vehPtType` must now be str type.  
1.2.1 -- improved time dilation and added test for it  
1.1.7 -- get_numba_veh() and get_numba_cyc() can now be called from already jitted objects  
1.1.6 -- another bug fix for numba compatibility with corresponding unit test  
1.1.5 -- bug fix for numba compatibility of fcPeakEffOverride and mcPeakEffOverride  
1.1.4 -- nan bug fix for fcPeakEffOverride and mcPeakEffOverride  
1.1.3 -- provisioned for optional load time motor and engine peak overrides  
1.1.2 -- made vehicle loading _more_ more robust  
1.1.1 -- made vehicle loading more robust  
1.1.0 -- separated jitclasses into own module, made vehicle engine and motor efficiency setting more robust  
1.0.4 -- bug fix with custom engine curve  
1.0.3 -- bug fixes, faster testing  
1.0.2 -- forced type np.float64 on vehicle mass attributes  
1.0.1 -- Added `vehYear` attribute to vehicle and other minor changes.    
1.0.0 -- Implemented unittest package.  Fixed energy audit calculations to be based on achieved speed.  Updated this file.  Improved documentation.  Vehicle can be instantiated as dict.   
0.1.5 -- Updated to be compatible with ADOPT    
0.1.4 -- Bug fix: `mcEffMap` is now robust to having zero as first element    
0.1.3 -- Bug fix: `fastsim.vehicle.Vehicle` method `set_init_calcs` no longer overrides `fcEffMap`.    
0.1.2 -- Fixes os-dependency of xlwings by not running stuff that needs xlwings.  Improvements in functional test.  Refinment utomated typying of jitclass objects.    
0.1.1 -- Now includes label fuel economy and/or battery kW-hr/mi values that match excel and test for benchmarking against Excel values and CPU time.

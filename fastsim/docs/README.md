# Description
This is the python/rust flavor of FASTSim which is based on the original Excel implementation. Effort will be made to keep the core methodology between this software and the Excel flavor in line with one another. Other FASTSim flavors may spin off as variations on this core functionality, but these should integrated back into `main` if there is any intent of persistence.

All classes and methods are self-documented.  

# Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

       git clone git@github.nrel.gov:MBAP/fastsim.git

2. Set up an environment for the project. There are two ways to do this:

   - Using Anaconda (with Python 3.8 or newer):

         conda create -n fastsim python=3.8
         conda activate fastsim
         conda install -c conda-forge "rust>=1.64"

   - Manually:
     - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
     - Then, using a virtual environment, and making sure to use Python >= 3.8:
    
        PowerShell:

            python -m venv .venv
            .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

        Bash:

            python -m venv .venv
            source .venv/bin/activate

        Command Prompt:

            python -m venv .venv
            .venv/Scripts/activate.bat
    
3. From within the top level of the FASTSim repository, install using pip:

       pip install .

## Developers
Developers might want to install the code in place so that FASTSim files can be editable (the `-e` flag for pip provides this behavior). This option can be handy since FASTSim will be installed in place from the installation location and any updates will be propagated each time FASTSim is freshly imported.  

To do this, a couple of extra steps are required:

1. First install the python code in place `DEVELOP_MODE=True pip install -e ".[dev]"` if on Mac OS, Linux, or Windows Bash (e.g. git bash, VSCode bash).  On Windows in Power Shell or Command Prompt, run `set DEVELOP_MODE=True` then `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
1. Within the same python environment, navigate to `fastsim/rust/` and run `pip install maturin`.
1. _Optional_: Within the `rust/` folder (which contains the rust `src/` folder), run `cargo test --release` to build and run the tests.
1. In `fastsim/rust/fastsim-py`, you should now be able to run `maturin develop --release`, which will enable the tests that use rust to run.  You should also now be able to run `fastsim/fastsim/docs/demo.py`.

After FASTSim has been installed as editable per the above instructions, you can rebuild and test everything with `sh build_and_test.sh` in Windows bash or `./build_and_test.sh` in Linux/Unix in the `fastsim/` dir.  

# Users with NREL VPN Access
## Installation as PyPi Package
Note: the following instructions work only if you are inside NREL VPN:  
To install and/or update, run
```
pip install fastsim --upgrade --extra-index-url=https://github.nrel.gov/pages/MBAP/mbap-pypi/
```

## Adding FASTSim as a Depency in Rust
Add this line:  
`fastsim-core = { git = "https://github.nrel.gov/MBAP/fastsim", branch = "rust-port" }`  
to your Cargo.toml file, modifying the `branch` key as appropriate.  

# Usage
To see and run examples, navigate to fastsim/docs and run the various *demo.py files to see fastsim use cases. There are other examples in fastsim/tests.  

To get help in an interactive ipython or jupyter session:  
```
import fastsim
fastsim.simdrive.SimDriveClassic? # or
help(fastsim.simdrive.SimDriveClassic)
```

Help can be used in this manner on any FASTSim object.

# Testing

The `unittest` package has been implemented such that you can run `python -m unittest discover` from within the fastsim folder, and all tests will be automatically discovered and run.  

## Against Previous Python Version

To run tests, first run the command `from fastim import tests`.  
To compare FASTSim back to the master branch version from 17 December 2019, run `tests.test26veh3cyc.main()`.  For timing comparisons, run `tests.test26veh3cyc_CPUtime.main()`.  

## Against Excel FASTSim
To compare Python FASTSim results to Excel FASTSim, you can run `tests.test_vs_excel.main()` to do an experimental (i.e. beta) comparison against saved Excel results. If you have the Excel version (obtainable here: [https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/fastsim.html](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/fastsim.html)) of FASTSim open, you can specify `rerun_excel=True` to do a live run of the Excel version.

FASTSim Rust crates are organized as a cargo [workspace](Cargo.toml) as follows:
1. `fastsim-core`: a pure rust lib crate with optional `pyo3` feature.  This crate is intended to be used by other crates and is not in itself an app.
1. `fastsim-cli`: a wrapper around `fastsim-core` to enable a standalone CLI app for running fastsim and getting results out.  
1. `fastsim-py`: a wrapper around `fastsim-core` to expose structs, methods, and functions to python via the enabled `pyo3` feature.  This is set up to install `fastsim-py` as `fastsimrust` in [fastsim-py/python/fastsimrust](./fastsim-py/python/fastsimrust/) when `maturin develop --release` is run, per [these instructions](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin/blob/084cfaced651b28616aeea1f818bdc933a536bfe/guide/src/project_layout.md#mixed-rustpython-project).
